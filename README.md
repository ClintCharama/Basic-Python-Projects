# My Basic Projects

This repository contains a collection of small projects I built while learning and practicing programming fundamentals. The goal of these projects is to reinforce core concepts, improve problem-solving skills, and track my progress over time.

## What This Repository Is About
- Practicing programming basics through hands-on projects  
- Turning theoretical concepts into working code  
- Building a strong foundation for more advanced topics  

## Concepts Practiced
- Variables and data types  
- User input and output  
- Conditional logic  
- Loops  
- Functions  
- Strings and data structures (lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries)  
- Basic algorithms and logical thinking  

## Project Structure
Each project is independent and focuses on a specific idea or concept. Projects are kept simple and readable, with clarity prioritized over complexity.

Typical structure:
- One project per file or folder  
- Clear naming and straightforward logic  
- Minimal external dependencies  

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ClintCharama/Basic-Python-Projects.git
2. Open the files in a code editor
3. Run the projects using the appropriate language interpreter (e.g. Python)

## Why I Built These

* To practice consistently
* To document my learning journey
* To prepare for more complex projects and coding challenges

## Future Plans

* Add more projects with increasing difficulty
* Refactor earlier projects as my skills improve
* Apply better structure and error handling over time

## Notes

These projects are intentionally simple and may not follow best practices in all cases. They reflect my learning stage at the time they were written.
